This feature of the AI lip-sync generator API expands creative possibilities for music videos, entertainment projects, and social media content, turning static portraits into engaging talking videos API outputs.

Visual Understanding with Wan2.1 Backbone
Built on the robust Wan 2.1 video diffusion model, the InfiniteTalk AI API benefits from strong visual understanding of human anatomy, facial expressions, and body movements, resulting in realistic and consistent talking avatars.

Sparse-Frame Video Dubbing with InfiniteTalk
InfiniteTalk introduces a sparse-frame dubbing framework that aligns not only lip movements, but also head motion, posture, and facial expressions with the input audio. This creates highly expressive and natural talking videos.

Infinite-Length Talking Videos API
Unlike most lip-sync tools limited to short clips, InfiniteTalk enables infinite-length video generation, making it ideal for podcasts, lectures, and other long-form digital content where duration is not a limitation.

How InfiniteTalk AI API Works with Wan 2.1
Wan 2.1 as the Video Generation Backbone
Wan 2.1 is an image-to-video model that generates continuous video frames from a single image. Within the InfiniteTalk AI API, Wan 2.1 acts as the visual backbone, ensuring motion stability and temporal consistency for long-form video generation.

InfiniteTalk AI API Adds Audio-Driven Lip Sync
