                      A description of the desired audio content.  

                      - In Custom Mode (`customMode: true`): Required if
                      `instrumental` is `false`. The prompt will be strictly
                      used as the lyrics and sung in the generated track.
                      Character limits by model:  
                        - **V3_5 & V4**: Maximum 3000 characters  
                        - **V4_5 & V4_5PLUS**: Maximum 5000 characters  
                        - **V5**: Maximum 5000 characters

                      - In Non-custom Mode (`customMode: false`): Always
                      required. The prompt serves as the core idea, and lyrics
                      will be automatically generated based on it (not strictly
                      matching the input). Maximum 500 characters.  
                        Example: "A short relaxing piano tune"

                      - If `true`: Allows detailed control with specific
                      requirements for `style` and `title` fields.

                      required and other parameters are ignored.

                      - In Custom Mode (`customMode: true`):  
                        - If `true`: Only `style` and `title` are required.  
                        - If `false`: `style`, `title`, and `prompt` are required (with prompt used as the exact lyrics).  
                      - In Non-custom Mode (`customMode: false`): No impact on
                      required fields (prompt only).

                      The URL to receive music generation task completion
                      updates. Required for all music generation requests.


                      - System will POST task status and results to this URL
                      when generation completes

                      - Callback process has three stages: `text` (text
                      generation), `first` (first track complete), `complete`
                      (all tracks complete)

                      - Note: Some cases may skip `text` and `first` stages and
                      return `complete` directly

                      - Your callback endpoint should accept POST requests with
                      JSON payload containing task results and audio URLs

                      - For detailed callback format and implementation guide,
                      see [Music Generation
                      Callbacks](./generate-music-callbacks)

                      - Alternatively, use the Get Music Details endpoint to
                      poll task status
