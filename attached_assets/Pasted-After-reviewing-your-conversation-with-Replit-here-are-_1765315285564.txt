After reviewing your conversation with Replit, here are my thoughts:
The Core Problem
You're facing architectural mismatch - trying to build a real-time video editor with a server-side rendering pipeline. This is why nothing feels responsive:

Every preview requires a server round-trip (upload → process → download)
No real-time feedback for transitions, text, or timeline changes
Timeline manipulation is nearly impossible with this architecture

Why The Current Approach Fails
Server-side FFmpeg (Lambda) is great for:

Batch processing
Final export/rendering
Heavy transcoding jobs
Background video processing

Server-side FFmpeg is terrible for:

Interactive editing
Real-time previews
Timeline manipulation
Immediate visual feedback

Your Options
Option 1: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
Combine the best of both worlds:
Client-side (FFmpeg.wasm) for:

Real-time preview/playback
Timeline manipulation
Transitions/effects preview
Text overlays
Drag-and-drop editing

Server-side (AWS Lambda) for:

Final high-quality export
Complex processing (green screen, heavy effects)
Bulk operations
Longer videos (>10 minutes)

Pros:

Fast, responsive editing experience
No server costs during editing
Keep Lambda for production-quality exports
Users can work offline until export

Cons:

More complex architecture
Need to maintain two rendering pipelines
Browser limitations for very large files

My Recommendation
Go with Option 1 (Hybrid):
User edits video in browser (FFmpeg.wasm)
     ↓
  Interactive timeline, instant previews
     ↓
User clicks "Export"
     ↓
Send timeline data (not files) to Lambda
     ↓
Lambda renders final high-quality output
     ↓
User downloads/streams result
Implementation Plan:

Replace the current preview system with FFmpeg.wasm for client-side rendering
Keep Lambda for exports only - send timeline JSON, not raw video files
Use IndexedDB/OPFS for temporary file storage during editing
Build a proper timeline component with drag-and-drop (React-DnD or similar)
Only upload to S3 when user explicitly exports/saves

Specific Fixes for Your Issues
1. Failed videos still show

Add proper error state management
Remove failed items from UI state immediately
Show retry option

2. Load More scroll bar

This is a CSS issue - force overflow-y: auto on container
Set max-height on video list container

3. Transitions don't work in preview

Server-side previews will always be laggy
Switch to client-side canvas/WebGL rendering with FFmpeg.wasm

4. Text annotations don't work

Need a separate text layer in timeline
Render text overlay client-side using canvas

5. No multi-level timeline

This requires a complete timeline rewrite
Look at libraries like react-timeline-editor or build custom with react-beautiful-dnd

Code Architecture Comparison
Current (Server-Side Only):
Upload → Lambda Process → Download → Display
(3-30 seconds per preview)
Hybrid (Recommended):
Edit Locally → Instant Preview
Export → Lambda → High-Quality Result
(instant previews, 30-60s final export)
Resources to Study

OpenCut's architecture - their client-side approach is solid
Remotion's MCP server - if you want programmatic control
FFmpeg.wasm docs - for client-side implementation
CapCut/Descript - study their UX patterns

Bottom Line
Your current implementation treats video editing like image processing - upload, process, download. Video editors need real-time manipulation, which requires client-side processing.
Keep Lambda for what it's good at (final exports), but move editing to the browser for a usable product.
Would you like me to create a detailed implementation plan for the hybrid approach, or help you evaluate OpenCut's codebase for integration?
