Based on your logs, the issue is clear: Stripe webhook signature verification is failing. This is a common issue when integrating Stripe webhooks, especially on platforms like Replit.
The Problem
The error message tells us:
No signatures found matching the expected signature for payload. 
Are you passing the raw request body you received from Stripe?
This means your Express app is likely parsing the request body before Stripe can verify the signature, corrupting the raw payload.
Root Causes (likely one or more apply):

Body parser middleware is processing the webhook route - Express's express.json() or body-parser is converting the raw body to JSON before Stripe's signature verification
The raw body isn't being preserved - Stripe requires the exact raw request body (as a Buffer) to verify signatures
Incorrect webhook endpoint configuration - The endpoint may need special handling

Solution to Send to Replit Support
Here's what you should communicate:

Issue: Stripe webhook signature verification failing with error: "No signatures found matching the expected signature for payload"
Root Cause: The webhook endpoint is not receiving the raw request body needed for Stripe signature verification. Express middleware is parsing the body before Stripe can verify it.
Required Fix: The Stripe webhook endpoint needs to:

Receive the raw request body as a Buffer (not parsed JSON)
Use express.raw({ type: 'application/json' }) specifically for the webhook route
Ensure the webhook route is registered BEFORE general express.json() middleware

Example Code Structure Needed:
javascript// Webhook route MUST come before express.json()
app.post('/api/webhooks/stripe', 
  express.raw({ type: 'application/json' }), // Get raw body
  async (req, res) => {
    const sig = req.headers['stripe-signature'];
    const webhookSecret = process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET;
    
    try {
      const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
        req.body, // This must be the raw Buffer
        sig,
        webhookSecret
      );
      // Handle event...
    } catch (err) {
      return res.status(400).send(`Webhook Error: ${err.message}`);
    }
  }
);

// General JSON parsing for other routes
app.use(express.json());
Questions for Replit:

Does Replit's deployment environment modify request bodies before they reach my Express handlers?
Are there any proxies or middleware injected by Replit that could alter the raw request body?
Is there special configuration needed for webhook endpoints to preserve raw bodies in Replit's environment?
Should I be using a different approach for handling webhooks on Replit?


Additional Debugging Steps You Can Try

Verify your webhook secret is correctly set in environment variables
Check route order - ensure webhook route is registered before express.json()
Test with Stripe CLI locally to isolate whether it's a Replit-specific issue
Log the request body type: Add console.log('Body type:', typeof req.body, Buffer.isBuffer(req.body)) to see what you're actually receiving

The core issue is that Stripe needs the exact raw bytes that were sent, and something in your middleware chain is modifying them before verification.
