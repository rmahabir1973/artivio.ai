Pixabay API
Welcome to the Pixabay API documentation. Our API is a RESTful interface for searching and retrieving royalty-free images and videos released by Pixabay under the Content License.


Free ImagesIf you make use of the API, show your users where the images and videos are from, whenever search results are displayed. That's the one thing we kindly request in return for free API usage.

The API returns JSON-encoded objects. Hash keys and values are case-sensitive and character encoding is in UTF-8. Hash keys may be returned in any random order and new keys may be added at any time. We will do our best to notify our users before removing hash keys from results or adding required parameters.

Rate Limit
By default, you can make up to 100 requests per 60 seconds. Requests are associated with the API key, and not with your IP address. The response headers tell you everything you need to know about your current rate limit status:

Header name	Description
X-RateLimit-Limit	The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make in 60 seconds.
X-RateLimit-Remaining	The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.
X-RateLimit-Reset	The remaining time in seconds after which the current rate limit window resets.
To keep the Pixabay API fast for everyone, requests must be cached for 24 hours. Also, the API is made for real human requests; do not send lots of automated queries. Systematic mass downloads are not allowed. If needed, we can increase this limit at any time - given that you've implemented the API properly.

Hotlinking
Returned image URLs may be used for temporarily displaying search results. However, permanent hotlinking of images (using Pixabay URLs in your app) is not allowed. If you intend to use the images, please download them to your server first. Videos may be embedded directly in your applications. Yet, we recommend storing them on your server.

Error Handling
If an error occurs, a response with propper HTTP error status code is returned. The body of this response contains a description of the issue in plain text. For example, once you go over the rate limit you will receive an HTTP error 429 ("Too Many Requests") with the message "API rate limit exceeded".
