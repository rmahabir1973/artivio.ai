Great question! Currently the preview is generated server-side with FFmpeg, which is slow. Real-time preview like CapCut/Premiere would require a different approach.

  Let me check what's already in place for client-side preview.

● Search(pattern: "ffmpeg\.wasm|FFmpeg.*wasm|createFFmpeg|canvas.*video|VideoFrame|WebCodecs", path: "client")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 

● Read(client/src/pages/video-editor/components/preview-surface.tsx)
  ⎿  Read 251 lines

● Currently there's no real-time preview - just a single pre-rendered video from the server. Here are the realistic options:

  Real-Time Preview Options

  Option 1: Client-Side Canvas Compositing (Recommended)

  How CapCut/Canva web editors do it:
  - Load each source video as hidden <video> elements
  - Use <canvas> to draw the current frame based on timeline position
  - Switch between video sources as playhead moves
  - Handle transitions with opacity blending
  - Use Web Audio API for audio preview

  Pros: Instant feedback, no server calls, works offline
  Cons: Complex implementation, transitions are approximated, ~2-3 days of work

  Option 2: FFmpeg.wasm (WebAssembly)

  - Run FFmpeg directly in the browser
  - Your replit.md mentions this was planned but not implemented

  Pros: Full FFmpeg features in browser
  Cons: Still takes 10-30+ seconds to process, not truly "real-time"

  Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Quickest Win)

  - Scrubbing preview: Play source videos directly (no processing) - instant
  - Full preview: Keep current server-side FFmpeg for accurate preview with effects
  - Mark preview as "approximate" during scrubbing

  My Recommendation

  Start with Option 3 (Hybrid) - quickest to implement:
  1. Show source videos directly during timeline scrubbing (instant playback)
  2. Keep "Generate Preview" for full-fidelity preview with transitions/effects
  3. Auto-generate preview when user pauses editing (debounced, e.g., 3 seconds of inactivity)

  Then later upgrade to Option 1 for true real-time compositing.
