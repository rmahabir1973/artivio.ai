Follow-up to Replit - Implementation Approval
Perfect! Your responses address all my concerns and the technical choices are solid. I'm ready to move forward with a few final clarifications:

1. Timeline & Milestones (Need Specific Dates)
You mentioned starting Phase 1 today, but I need target completion dates for tracking:
Can you provide specific dates for each phase?
PhaseDescriptionYour Estimated DurationTarget Completion DatePhase 1Scroll bar + filter failed videos??Phase 2FFmpeg.wasm integration + preview??Phase 3Multi-track timeline with drag-drop??Phase 4Lambda export integration??
My suggested timeline (please confirm or adjust):

Phase 1: Today/Tomorrow (Dec 10-11)
Phase 2: By Dec 18 (1 week)
Phase 3: By Jan 2 (2 weeks over holidays)
Phase 4: By Jan 8 (1 week)

Question: Does this work with your schedule, or do you need different dates?

2. Phase 1 - Starting Today
You said you can apply the scroll bar fix today. Great!
Action Items for Phase 1:
2.1 Scroll Bar Fix
Apply this exact CSS to client/src/components/VideoEditor/MediaLibrary.css (or wherever your media library styles are):
css.media-library-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  height: 100vh; /* Adjust if you have a header */
  overflow: hidden;
}

.media-grid-wrapper {
  flex: 1;
  overflow-y: auto;
  overflow-x: hidden;
  padding: 20px;
}

.media-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  gap: 16px;
  padding-bottom: 20px;
}
Question: Which file will you modify? Can you share the current file path?
2.2 Filter Failed Videos
At the API level (preferred):
javascript// In your media API endpoint
const validMedia = allMedia.filter(item => 
  item.status === 'completed' || 
  item.status === 'ready' ||
  item.status === 'success'
);
Questions:

What are the possible status values in your database?
Which API endpoint returns the media list? (/api/media or different?)
Can you push Phase 1 to staging/dev today for me to test?


3. Fabric.js - Lazy Loading Requirement
I approve using Fabric.js for text overlays, but with one requirement:
Must be lazy-loaded - only import when user clicks "Add Text" button:
javascript// Good - lazy load
const addTextOverlay = async () => {
  const { fabric } = await import('fabric');
  // Initialize Fabric.js here
};

// Bad - loads for everyone
import { fabric } from 'fabric'; // ❌ Loads 200KB for all users
Question: Can you confirm Fabric.js will be lazy-loaded?

4. Updated Timeline Data Structure
Perfect addition of zIndex! Here's the complete structure we're aligned on:
typescriptinterface TimelineItem {
  id: string;
  type: 'video' | 'image' | 'text' | 'audio';
  track: number;
  startTime: number;
  duration: number;
  url: string;
  zIndex?: number;  // ✅ Your addition
  
  trim?: { start: number; end: number };
  transition?: { type: string; duration: number };
  text?: {
    content: string;
    fontSize: number;
    color: string;
    position: { x: number; y: number };
    fontFamily?: string;
  };
  volume?: number;
  position?: { x: number; y: number; width: number; height: number };
}
Question: Should we also add these for future features?
typescriptopacity?: number;        // 0.0 to 1.0 for fade effects
rotation?: number;       // degrees for rotated overlays
filter?: string;         // 'grayscale', 'sepia', 'blur', etc.
