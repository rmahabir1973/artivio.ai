/api/v1/jobs/createTask
Create Task
Create a new generation task

Request Parameters
The API accepts a JSON payload with the following structure:

Request Body Structure
{
  "model": "string",
  "callBackUrl": "string (optional)",
  "input": {
    // Input parameters based on form configuration
  }
}
Root Level Parameters
model
Required
string
The model name to use for generation

Example:

"kling/v2-5-turbo-image-to-video-pro"
callBackUrl
Optional
string
Callback URL for task completion notifications. Optional parameter. If provided, the system will send POST requests to this URL when the task completes (success or failure). If not provided, no callback notifications will be sent.

Example:

"https://your-domain.com/api/callback"
Input Object Parameters
The input object contains the following parameters based on the form configuration:

input.prompt
Required
string
Text description for the video generation

Max length: 2500 characters
Example:

"Astronaut instantly teleports through a glowing magical wooden door. Handheld tracking, camera stays 5–10 meters above and behind, smooth third-person chase. Hyper-realistic base, each scene with distinct art style, instant scene flashes with bright portal glow, high detail, 8K, epic orchestral undertones. High-frame interpolation for smooth motion and sharp instant transitions. Close-up: astronaut in white suit falls rapidly through glowing portal underfoot.\nFirst transition: LEGO Alps, high-saturation daylight, snowy peaks and valleys below, astronaut falls, next portal opens.\nSecond transition: Amazon rainforest, dense canopy and rivers below, astronaut falls, next portal opens.\nThird transition: Ancient Egypt, Giza pyramids in mural style, desert and Nile below, astronaut falls, next portal opens.\nFourth transition: abstract black-and-white ink style, Chinese Great Wall below, astronaut falls, final portal opens.\nFifth transition: New York night, realistic dark skyline, glowing city lights, Empire State Building, astronaut hovers elegantly. Camera maintains constant distance, slight orbit, smooth third-person tracking throughout. Each portal transition is a sharp flash, emphasizing speed and magical journey, abrupt style and location shifts."
input.image_url
Required
string(URL)
URL of the image to be used for the video

File URL after upload, not file content; Accepted types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp; Max size: 10.0MB

Example:

"5"
input.negative_prompt
Optional
string
Elements to avoid in the video

Max length: 2496 characters
Example:

"blur, distort, and low quality"
input.cfg_scale
Optional
number
The CFG (Classifier Free Guidance) scale is a measure of how close you want the model to stick to your prompt

Important Notes
The callback content structure is identical to the Query Task API response
The param field contains the complete Create Task request parameters, not just the input section
If callBackUrl is not provided, no callback notifications will be sent
