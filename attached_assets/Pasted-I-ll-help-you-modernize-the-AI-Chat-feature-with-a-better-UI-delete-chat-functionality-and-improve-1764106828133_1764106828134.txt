I'll help you modernize the AI Chat feature with a better UI, delete chat functionality, and improved formatting. Let me first examine the current implementation:


Show 4 more

Executed grep -n "POST.*conversation\|GET.*conversation" server/routes.ts | head -10

Planned UI modernization and organization
Perfect! I can see the delete functionality is already there. Now I'll modernize the chat interface with:

Modern UI design (Deepseek/OpenAI style)
Markdown formatting support (code blocks, colors, formatted text)
Better conversation organization (group by Today, Yesterday, etc.)
Let me make these improvements:


Show less

Executed grep "markdown\|remark\|rehype" package.json

Executed grep -n "DELETE.*conversation\|deleteConversation" server/routes.ts | head -3

Executed ls client/src/components/ | grep -i message

Planned UI modernization and installation (4 seconds)
I'll modernize the chat interface with markdown support and better UI. Let me install the necessary dependencies and make the changes:


Installed react-markdown, rehype-raw, date-fns

Decided on component structure
Now I'll create a modern ChatMessage component with markdown support and update the chat UI:


Created client/src/components/chat-message.tsx

Restarted Start application

Decided on date grouping utility
Now I'll create a utility for grouping conversations by date and update the chat.tsx with the modern UI:


Created client/src/lib/dateGrouping.ts

Decided on chat UI rewrite
Now I'll update the chat.tsx with the modern Deepseek-style UI and date grouping:


Edited client/src/pages/chat.tsx

Reimagined chat UI design
Perfect! Now let me restart the app to apply all the changes:


Restarted Start application

Verified application restart and changes
Let me verify the app is running correctly:


Executed sleep 5 && curl -s http://localhost:5000/ | head -c 100 && echo "\n✓ App is running"
Checked console and system logs
